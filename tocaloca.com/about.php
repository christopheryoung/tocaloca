		 <p>Since their inception in 2001, Toca Loca has been furiously branding
the cattle of the new music world, and has long been held up as the
best argument against intelligent design. <img class="right" src="images/tocagothic_b_and_w.jpg" alt="Toca Gothic" width="250" />Sworn enemies of actuaries
and slow-growth fund managers the world over, percussionist Aiyun
Huang and pianists Simon Docking and Gregory Oh have introduced North
American audiences to new works of Chris Paul Harman, Andrew
Staniland, Hywel Davies, Inouk Demers, Heinz Holliger, Sofia
Gubaidulina, Philippe Leroux, Toshio Hosokawa, Georges Aperghis and
Valerio Sannicandro.</p>


<p>Frequent contributors to the CBC's Two New Hours and

No stranger to the popular scene, he has worked with Kurt Swinghammer, Andrew Downing, Andrew Craig, Quinsin Nachoff, John Gzowski and the Redemption Steel Orchestra, and as the keyboardist in uberband The Lollipop People has played Pop Montreal, NXNE, Wavelength, Galapagos, the Guelph Folk Festival and the Brampton Indie Arts Festival.
